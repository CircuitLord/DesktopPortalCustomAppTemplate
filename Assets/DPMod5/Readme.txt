The parent folder of this file called 'DPMod5' is known as the 'Mod Folder' and this is where all mod content should be placed in order for it to be exported. 
Any content that is not inside this folder will not be exported unless they are a dependancy for another asset, For example, a material. 
You can organize your assets into sub folders but bear in mind that the asset will retain its local path when built so when loading assets dynamically you may need to specify the local path instead of the asset name in order to avoid conflicts.
